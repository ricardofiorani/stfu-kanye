# What's this ?

This is a Bot developed over Zend-Expressive that basically just replies every tweet from Kanye West with a warm and friendly response.

# Where can I see it working ?

# Why ?
Because fuck Kanye West, that's why.

# It took 8 hours of work, did it Worth it ?
Yes.

# Technologies used
 * Zend-Expressive (https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive)

# Footnotes

Currently the bot runs on a Pagodabox free plan, so Pagodabox likes to shut it down sometimes requiring me to login on their dashboard and wake the app up.
